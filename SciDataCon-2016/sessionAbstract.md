## Session Type - Mixed Paper Session

Sessions explicitly seeking to have a mix of research and practice papers.  It may also be permissible to include poster presentations in such sessions.

## Anticipated Contributors, Participants



## Themes and Scope

[Link to online listing.](http://www.scidatacon.org/site/themes-scope/)

Addressing major research questions from the perspective of data issues.  This includes research into:

* data availability and data quality for research;
* disciplinary and interdisciplinary case studies of data issues, data (non-)availability, barriers and solutions; 

The discussion of such data issues should relate concretely and directly to specific research questions.
Data Science and Data Analysis

Addressing the frontier scientific, technical and epistemological challenges associated with data in research.  This includes research into:

* issues around reproducibility, statistical and technical challenges in data intensive research;
* data science and infrastructures for Big Data;
* interoperability standards in data and metadata, including brokering and mediation;
* data systems architecture; and so on.

Data Stewardship

Addressing issues to advance sustainable, long-term data stewardship.  This includes research into:

* data management and curation systems and practice;
* developing institutional, national and international data repositories and services;
* sustainability of data infrastructure;
* long term digital preservation;
* data stewardship in the research lifecycle and in research infrastructures;

Policy and Practice of Data in Research

Addressing research into data policies and practice, and the role of data in scholarly communications.  This includes research into:

* data policy development and harmonization;
* costs, value proposition, business models and economics of data infrastructure;
    mapping the limits of Open Data;
    data publication and citation;
    research data and scholarly communications;
    motivations, recognitions and reward in research practice; and so on.

Education and Data

Addressing research into educational and training responses to the Data Revolution.  This includes research into:

* capacity building and education in data science, data management and data handling;
* curricula and competency frameworks for data in research; and so on.

Data, Society, Ethics and Politics

Addressing research into the broader dimensions of data and data driven research in relation to society.  This includes research into:

## Open research data and Open public data;

Session Organizers:

* Karl Benedict (University of New Mexico)
* W Christopher Lehnhardt (RENCI)
* Joshua Young (NCAR)

## Initial organizing thoughts:

* Conceptual overview based on continued evolution of ideas from paper/lit review
* Community concepts of agile curation
  * Test-driven curation (participant in our RDA P6 BOF [from Germany])
  * Adaptive and product-driven (Denise)
* Case studies as a vehicle for developing *design patterns*
* Initial synthesis strategy and results from *design pattern* work. 

## Abstract Text

The development of agile software development principles, including test-driven development, and adoption of a variety of practices based upon those principles has produced significant improvements in the speed with which value is delivered to software users and the longer term sustainability of the software. In the science software context agile development practices also contribute to reproducibility. The agile development principles that have improved software development have potential, with modifications, for application to all phases of the research data lifecycle, to increase the efficiency of research data creation, management, documentation, preservation, discovery, access and reuse. Research and development of the conceptual model for agile data curation has been an active area of work for the session proposers, and as part of this work they have expanded the network of involved researchers engaged on the topic over the past 15 months to include contributors to sessions presented at the 2014 and 2015 American Geophysical Union Fall meeting and participants in the Fifth and Sixth Research Data Alliance Plenary meetings in 2015. Recently the team has developed a plan for building upon the collection of case studies presented as part of the above listed meetings by systematically collecting data management, preservation and sharing case studies from researchers in diverse Earth Science research and applications communities in an effort to identify common practices that are aligned with agile data curation principles (though perhaps not intentionally so). These case studies will then provide the basis for the development of agile data management design patterns that provide examples of data management processes that are consistent with the principles of agile data management. Through the identification of agile development design patterns it will be possible to 1) encourage the adoption of those design patterns in new data creation and management activities, and 2) provide a reference model against which practices may be compared, both in an effort to identify opportunities for greater efficiency and increased research data reusability and to recognize activities that have already achieved a high level of alignment with the principles and practices upon which the design patterns are based. 

This session will focus on papers that address three aspects of agile data management: the refinement of a modified set of principles that may be applied to the research data lifecycle, illustrations of alternative scientific data workflows that demonstrate these principles, and the case studies approach that is being developed by the session organizers to produce research data management design patterns that balance efficiency of in-project data management and effective data reuse long after the end of the project that created the data. The presenters that will be invited to contribute to the session include the session organizers who will present on the further work that they have done in systematically developing the principles of agile data curation using agile software curation as a point of reference; researchers from a variety of Earth science communities and projects with whom the session organizers have worked including one or more NSF Earth Cube research teams, the Geological Survey of Alabama, NASA, and members of the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation) - from whom alternative community visions of what constitutes agile data curation within their particular community or organizational context will be solicited; and the session organizers and key community members in presenting an initial template and samples of design patterns that will be developed as a product of the planned ongoing collection of case studies from an increasingly broad sample of research communities both within and outside the Earth sciences.
